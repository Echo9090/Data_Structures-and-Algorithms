Data Structures and Algorithm Assignment:

This Python program, is designed to solve arithmetic expressions and graph them based on user input. It leverages the powerful capabilities of the `matplotlib` package, which serves as the backbone of the entire codebase.

This program offers a solution for visualizing mathematical expressions through graphs. Users interact with the program by running the `assignment.py` script, which initiates the solving and graphing process. The program prompts users to select expressions from the provided set in the `values.txt` file. Once an expression is chosen, This program proceeds to compute the corresponding graph, providing users with a visual representation of the mathematical relationship.
